## Revolver Chrome Extensions ##
by Ben Hedrington

These extensions were created for using Google Chrome full-screen to power unattended screens like kiosks or tv displays where rotating dynamic/live web content is needed.

  * **Revolver - Tabs** (http://bit.ly/bQxAL4) takes your current open tabs and rotates between each of them pausing for as many seconds as you like and continuing until you stop it. Revolver - Tabs can reload the tabs on each view or not if you choose.

  * **Revolver - RSS** (http://bit.ly/dDhTkE) takes the URL of any RSS feed then rotates between each web page included in it pausing for as many seconds as you like and continuing until you stop it.

  * **Revolver - QR** (http://bit.ly/dzXPSe) This extension simply adds a QR code for the current URL of the tab to the lower right corner of the browser without the need to click any sort of browser button or key combination. This extension was built to allow people viewing monitors automated by my other Chrome extensions (Revolver - RSS and Revolver - Tabs) to capture the URLs of the pages they are seeing on-screen.
